Each advanced report is a snippet of code that can be copied and pasted in the advanced report section of the SCorp-io
designer platform.

Every advanced report is described in a README.MD file that is located in the same directory as the advanced report
code.

The README.MD file contains a description of the report and how to use it.

Don't hesitate to contribute by adding your own advanced reports to this repository.

Enjoy reporting !
